## Usage

### Local

When you open index.html directly in a browser, some features, especially those involving JavaScript, might not work properly due to the browser's CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy. To fully test your website as it would appear online, it's recommended to simulate a server environment locally.

```bash
py -3 -m http.server
```

Then, open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.
